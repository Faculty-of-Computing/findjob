## Development Practices

### Version Control
- **Git** for source code management
- **Feature branches** for new development
- **Pull requests** for code review
- **Semantic versioning** for releases

### Code Quality
- **PEP 8** compliance for Python code
- **Pre-commit hooks** for code formatting
- **Static analysis** with pylint/flake8
- **Code reviews** for all changes

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** for individual functions
- **Integration tests** for component interaction
- **End-to-end tests** for critical user flows
- **Automated testing** in CI/CD pipeline

### Documentation
- **Inline code documentation** with docstrings
- **API documentation** with OpenAPI/Swagger
- **User documentation** and guides
- **Architecture decision records**

## Quality Assurance

### Code Review Process
1. Developer creates feature branch
2. Implements changes with tests
3. Creates pull request with description
4. Code review by at least one team member
5. Automated tests run in CI
6. Merge after approval and passing tests

### Testing Standards
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Response time < 2 seconds
- **Security Standards**: OWASP Top 10 compliance
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Technology stack changes**: Mitigated by choosing stable, well-supported technologies
- **Scalability issues**: Addressed through modular architecture and performance testing
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and updates

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep**: Managed through agile prioritization and stakeholder communication
- **Resource constraints**: Planned with buffer time and contingency resources
- **Timeline delays**: Iterative development allows for adjustments

## Communication and Collaboration

### Team Communication
- **Daily stand-ups** for progress updates
- **Weekly planning meetings** for sprint planning
- **Retrospectives** for continuous improvement
- **Documentation** in shared knowledge base

### Stakeholder Engagement
- **Regular demos** of working software
- **Feedback sessions** for user validation
- **Progress reports** with metrics and milestones
- **Change management** for requirement updates
